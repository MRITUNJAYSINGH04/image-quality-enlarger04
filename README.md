Spaces Configuration Reference
Spaces are configured through the YAML block at the top of the README.md file at the root of the repository. All the accepted parameters are listed below.

title : string
Display title for the Space.

emoji : string
Space emoji (emoji-only character allowed).

colorFrom : string
Color for Thumbnail gradient (red, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple, pink, gray).

colorTo : string
Color for Thumbnail gradient (red, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple, pink, gray).

sdk : string
Can be either gradio, streamlit, docker, or static.

python_version: string
Any valid Python 3.x or 3.x.x version.
Defaults to 3.10.

sdk_version : string
Specify the version of the selected SDK (Streamlit or Gradio).
All versions of Gradio are supported.
All versions of Streamlit from 0.79.0 are supported.

suggested_hardware : string
Specify the suggested hardware on which this Space must be run.
Useful for Spaces that are meant to be duplicated by other users.
Setting this value will not automatically assign an hardware to this Space.
Value must be a valid hardware flavor. Current valid hardware flavors:

CPU: "cpu-basic", "cpu-upgrade"
GPU: "t4-small", "t4-medium", "l4x1", "l4x4", "a10g-small", "a10g-large", "a10g-largex2", "a10g-largex4","a100-large"
TPU: "v5e-1x1", "v5e-2x2", "v5e-2x4"
suggested_storage : string
Specify the suggested permanent storage on which this Space must be run.
Useful for Spaces that are meant to be duplicated by other users.
Setting this value will not automatically assign a permanent storage to this Space.
Value must be one of "small", "medium" or "large".

app_file : string
Path to your main application file (which contains either gradio or streamlit Python code, or static html code).
Path is relative to the root of the repository.

app_port : int
Port on which your application is running. Used only if sdk is docker. Default port is 7860.

base_path: string For non-static Spaces, initial url to render. Needs to start with /. For static Spaces, use app_file instead.

fullWidth: boolean
Whether your Space is rendered inside a full-width (when true) or fixed-width column (ie. ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù CSS) inside the iframe. Defaults to true.

header: string
Can be either mini or default. If header is set to mini the space will be displayed full-screen with a mini floating header .

short_description: string A short description of the Space. This will be displayed in the Space‚Äôs thumbnail.

models : List[string]
HF model IDs (like openai-community/gpt2 or deepset/roberta-base-squad2) used in the Space. Will be parsed automatically from your code if not specified here.

datasets : List[string]
HF dataset IDs (like mozilla-foundation/common_voice_13_0 or oscar-corpus/OSCAR-2109) used in the Space. Will be parsed automatically from your code if not specified here.

tags : List[string]
List of terms that describe your Space task or scope.

thumbnail: string
URL for defining a custom thumbnail for social sharing.

pinned : boolean
Whether the Space stays on top of your profile. Can be useful if you have a lot of Spaces so you and others can quickly see your best Space.

hf_oauth : boolean
Whether a connected OAuth app is associated to this Space. See Adding a Sign-In with HF button to your Space for more details.


hf_oauth_scopes : List[string] Authorized scopes of the connected OAuth app. openid and profile are authorized by default and do not need this parameter. See Adding a Sign-In with HF button to your space for more details.

hf_oauth_expiration_minutes : int Duration of the OAuth token in minutes. Defaults to 480 minutes (8 hours). Maximum duration is 43200 minutes (30 days). See Adding a Sign-In with HF button to your space for more details.

disable_embedding : boolean
Whether the Space iframe can be embedded in other websites. Defaults to false, i.e. Spaces can be embedded.

startup_duration_timeout: string
Set a custom startup duration timeout for your Space. This is the maximum time your Space is allowed to start before it times out and is flagged as unhealthy. Defaults to 30 minutes, but any valid duration (like 1h, 30m) is acceptable.

custom_headers : Dict[string, string]
Set custom HTTP headers that will be added to all HTTP responses when serving your Space.
For now, only the cross-origin-embedder-policy (COEP), cross-origin-opener-policy (COOP), and cross-origin-resource-policy (CORP) headers are allowed. These headers can be used to set up a cross-origin isolated environment and enable powerful features like SharedArrayBuffer, for example:

Copied
custom_headers:
  cross-origin-embedder-policy: require-corp
  cross-origin-opener-policy: same-origin
  cross-origin-resource-policy: cross-origin
Note: all headers and values must be lowercase.

preload_from_hub: List[string] Specify a list of Hugging Face Hub models or other large files to be preloaded during the build time of your Space. This optimizes the startup time by having the files ready when your application starts. This is particularly useful for Spaces that rely on large models or datasets that would otherwise need to be downloaded at runtime.

The format for each item is "repository_name" to download all files from a repository, or "repository_name file1,file2" for downloading specific files within that repository. You can also specify a specific commit to download using the format "repository_name file1,file2 commit_sha256".

Example usage:

Copied
preload_from_hub:
  - warp-ai/wuerstchen-prior text_encoder/model.safetensors,prior/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors
  - coqui/XTTS-v1
  - openai-community/gpt2 config.json 11c5a3d5811f50298f278a704980280950aedb10
In this example, the Space will preload specific .safetensors files from warp-ai/wuerstchen-prior, the complete coqui/XTTS-v1 repository, and a specific revision of the config.json file in the openai-community/gpt2 repository from the Hugging Face Hub during build time.

Files are saved in the default `huggingface_hub` disk cache `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`. If you application expects them elsewhere or you changed your `HF_HOME` variable, this pre-loading does not follow that at this time.
